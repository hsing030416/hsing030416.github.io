<h2 id="premise">About the show</h2>
	<p>
	<cite>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</cite> is an American police procedural comedy television series. Set in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department in Brooklyn, it follows a team of detectives headed by the serious and intellectual Captain Raymond Holt, who is assigned as their new commanding officer in the pilot episode. 
	The detectives include Jake Peralta, an investigator with a high rate of solved cases despite his relaxed and often childish attitude, who eventually falls for his nerdy, by-the-book, but skilled partner, Amy Santiago.
	Brilliant but immature detective Jake Peralta must learn to follow the rules and be a team player when his squad gets an exacting new captain.
